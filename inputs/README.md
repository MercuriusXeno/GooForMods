# Input Files
Each of these json files, with the exception of the `__common.json` file, represents a different mod that GooForMods currently provides support for.\
(The `__common.json` file contains information shared between multiple or all mods supported)

## Format
The format is currently quite new, and subject to change as Aeq functionality improves.\
For now, you should contact `Entoarox#0580` on the Goo discord for assistance if you are stuck.

## Datagen
These inputs files are used by the datagen program to generate the Aeq-readable json files in the `datapack` folder.
